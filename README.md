Welcome to the **Snake Game** project, a classic implementation of the famous Snake game. This repository contains the source code and resources needed to play and modify this fun game.

## Description

**Snake Game** is a game where you control a snake moving around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. It's a simple and enjoyable implementation of the classic Snake game, ideal for learning about game programming and collision logic.

## Features

- Smooth snake movement.
- Random food generation.
- Progressive increase in snake size.
- Collision detection with walls and the snake's own body.
- Score tracking and display during gameplay.

## Installation

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download the game:**

   Download the the .zip file of the game from the [releases page](https://github.com/AguirreSantiagoMi/my-snake-game.git).

2. **Extract the files:**

   Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the `snake-game.zip` file to a location of your choice on your computer.

3. **Run the game:**

   Navigate to the extracted folder and locate the `snake.exe` file. Double-click on `snake.exe` to start the game.

## Usage

Once the game is running, use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:

- **Up Arrow:** Move the snake up.
- **Down Arrow:** Move the snake down.
- **Left Arrow:** Move the snake left.
- **Right Arrow:** Move the snake right.
